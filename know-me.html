              Hi, I’m Ajith Alphonse, currently pursuing my Master’s in Information Systems at the University of Utah, where I focus on design and development. Before that, I completed my Bachelor’s in Architecture and Digital Design in India, along with a minor in User Experience Design, which basically means I’ve always been curious about how things look and how they work.
            </p>
            <p class="about-paragraph">
              My design journey started at 15 when I began building websites, creating templates, and experimenting with graphic design simply because I loved it. What started as curiosity slowly turned into a career. I also enjoy drawing human face portraits, a hobby that keeps my eye sharp and strengthens my sense of detail and visual storytelling.
            </p>
            <p class="about-paragraph">
              Over the past five years, I’ve worked in UX and product design across healthcare, fintech, education, and e-commerce. Currently, I’m working as a UI/UX Designer at the University of Utah Campus Store, where I continue to learn, build, and refine my craft while growing as a designer every day.

            I care about interfaces that respect people’s time, reduce anxiety, and feel visually calm — whether it’s a healthcare search flow, an enterprise dashboard, or a campus delivery map.
